# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 24, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: First day of the challenge! Feeling really good :D Today I've working on the react-responsive-gallery adding new examples to the demo page and also see some improvements that I can do to get a better component. It looks pretty neat at this point, but my fear is that as CSS grid do not improve the compatibility with another browser the gallery won't have any success, but it's really fun to write libraries :D
Another very important point is, this library was originated by the CSS grid course by Wes Bos which is excellent! So kudos to him!

### Day 2: January 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I continue working on the react gallery library, this time refactoring almost all the library to decouple the images from the modal. Now this one is being controlled by the gallery itself. Also, add the possibility to pass an onClick prop to the gallery, so if anyone wants to do something different from displaying the modal they can!

### Day 3: January 26, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I started working on my portfolio (which has been abandoned for a while with a WIP message ðŸ˜…). This time I decided to use Gatsby because I want to create a blog inside my portfolio, so I can start writing blogs there and in the future move them to medium. Also, if I made this log a bit richer in the information I can create one entry every day for the blog. So I use template for gatsby which has a beatiful UI and also the amount of pages that I want. So what do I add to the portofolio?
- Add at least one entry to the blog
- Change About page
- Change Contact page
- Use my free url and see how it goes.

### Day 4: January 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I've looking in more detail the gatsby starter and I finally understand how to enable comments inside the posts. It's using Disqus which is really great but for now I will disable it. My focus right now is to have a portfolio that can be send to another person, at least with my photo ðŸ˜‚ Also I tried to upload the portfolio to my DNS (emanuelsuriano.design) but I can't. In both platforms, there was a message saying that the changes may take up to 24 hours son lets hope that by tomorrow everything is gonna be fixed. I still need to continue working on the portfolio but it's looking good!

## Day 5: January 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to implement plugins inside gatsby, this time I wanted to use this one gatsby-remark-images. This plugin transform the img in mardown to beatiful lazy load images that have a blur effect while they are loading, so it's really cool because the content wont be start to gittering while are loading.

## Day 6: January 29, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I wrote my first serious article on my page, telling how I get my portfolio in one night. It took me a lot of work and time but I am really happy with the final product. I have a lot of grammatical mistakes but fortunately, my girlfriend helped me to solve them ðŸ˜˜

## Day 7: January 29, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to implement twitter cards in order to preview a beatiful card after pasting the link inside a tweets, so this is very important because the tweets seems more relevant with that card. Also get some fixes inside the previous article and upload my image inside the page.

## Day 8: January 30, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I've working with hotkeys in react, trying a few libraries like react-keydown, react-hotkeys, mousetrap and much more. I end up using any of them, because of the problem that if i want to use the shortcut I need to first focus the parent element. So tomorrow I will continue looking for the one that helps me solve this fucking task.

## Day 9: Febreaury 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I continue working on the hotkeys system for a react application. We were using react-hotkeys to catch the keys and call function after pressing the combination that we want. THe problem was that if we defined a hotkeuys componentn that wraps a small componennt in our app the shortcuts will only work if we are focusing that component (wont be globally usable). So we end up with a solution of wrapping the whole application with ONE HotKeys componentn so wherever we are focusing the shortcuts will work and then if a small component want to add a new shortcut to the application, it will get the context and call a functions subscribeHandler. Also when it will unmount, it has to call the unsubscribeHandler too.
We kind of create a hotkeys system where any component can add or remove shortcuts via context, and in my opinion it's really slick!
