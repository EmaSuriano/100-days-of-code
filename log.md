# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 24, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: First day of the challenge! Feeling really good :D Today I've working on the react-responsive-gallery adding new examples to the demo page and also see some improvements that I can do to get a better component. It looks pretty neat at this point, but my fear is that as css grid do not improve the compatibiltity with other browser the gallery wont have any success, but it's really fun to write libraries :D
Another very important point is, this library was originated by the css grid course by Wes Bos which is excellent! So kudos for him!

#### Overall status: Good

### Day 2: January 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I continue working on the react gallery library, this time refactoring almost all the library to decouple the images from the modal. Now this one is being controlled by the gallery itself. Also add the posibility to pass an onClick prop to the gallery, so if anyone want to do something different from displaying the modal they can!

#### Overall status: Regular
